This app allow users, without signup, to post and answer questions. This app needs a database with two related tables: questions and answers.
Their relationship is one-to-many. 

The code is based on the source code of the book "CakePHP Application Development" by Ahsanul Bari and Anupom Syam. I stripped of the signup process, with the controller for users.
I added the search function for questions using a key word. 

The search result is rendered to the search page with the AJAX API of cakePHP. This app demonstrates the convenience of using cakePHP AJAX API.
